# Comment Lister: Code Comment Listing Tool for Git repository

This tool automatically extracts comment in source code stored in a directory or a git repository.
The supported programming langauges are: C/C++14, Java8, ECMAScript, Python3, PHP, Ruby, and C#.
The tool also supports comments in build files: Makefiles (CMake, QMake, Automake), Bazel, Ant, and Maven.

This tool has been developed for writing the following papers:

## Build

The project uses Maven.  
You can make a runnable jar `CommentLister.jar` by executing `mvn package`. 

The build process requires JDK 11+ because dependent packages use JDK 11.


## Usage of Comment Extraction

The tool takes a file path to a git repository to be analyzed, for example:

        java -jar CommentLister.jar myapp/.git

All code comments in source code are extracted from the HEAD revision of the specified repository.  
An optional argument can choose a particular revision using a tag or a commit ID.

        java -jar CommentLister.jar myapp/.git -target=tag1
        java -jar CommentLister.jar myapp/.git -target=502af45

The tool reports comments in a JSON format.
The entire output is an object including the following attributes:
 - Repository: A specified directory.
 - Revision: A specified revision (HEAD by default).
 - ObjectId: The commit ID of the revision.
 - CommitTime: The commit time of the revision.
 - Files: A set of files (JSON Object). 
   - For each file, its file path, object ID, last modified time, file type, and a list of comments, and the number of comments are recorded.
   - A comment data includes the text, the line number, and char position in the line.
 - FileTypes: The numbers of source files recognized by the tool.
 - ElapsedTime: Milliseconds elapsed to process the files. 

The following JSON is an actual example extracted from the project's git repository.

        {
          "Repository" : "CommentLister/.git",
          "Revision" : "HEAD",
          "ObjectId" : "502af45efc6589972744a4bf90b90f6579e3189d",
          "CommitTime" : "2018-02-27T05:37:54Z",
          "Files" : {
            "src/jp/naist/se/commentlister/FileType.java" : {
              "ObjectId" : "d045a672cbf99df939a4b7d1a6be46120964b065",
              "LastModified" : "2018-02-27T05:37:54Z",
              "FileType" : "JAVA",
              "0" : {
                "Text" : "// Remove directories ",
                "Line" : 52,
                "CharPositionInLine" : 2
              },
              "1" : {
                "Text" : "// Mac OS's backup file",
                "Line" : 56,
                "CharPositionInLine" : 35
              },
              ...
              },
              "CommentCount" : 5
            },
          },
          "FileTypes" : {
            "JAVA" : 3
          },
          "ElapsedTime" : 562
        }



## Usage of Modified URL Extraction 

`GitDiffAnalyzer` extracts modified http(s) links from commits, while the main class of the tool (`jp.naist.se.commentlister.GitAnalyzer`) extracts all comments from a particular revision. 
The class requires three options: 
 - file path to repository, 
 - a programming language (one of CPP, JAVA, ECMASCRIPT, CSHARP, PYTHON, PHP, and RUBY)
 - a list of commits to be analyzed (you can make it by `git log --pretty=format:%H`)

The following commands extract URL changes from a repository in the current directory.

     git log --pretty=format:%H > commitid.txt
     java -classpath CommentLister.jar jp.naist.se.commentlister.GitDiffAnalyzer . java commitid.txt

The class reports added/deleted/modified URLs in a JSON format.
For each commit, comments including URLs are listed. 
An example extracted from <https://github.com/takashi-ishio/CommentLister-Test> repository is following: 

        {
          "41c0d21c53fd9b4e225be2eaa031ad8e13c25f88" : {
            "ShortMessage" : "Commit without URL change",
            "CommitTime" : "2018-08-08T02:26:47Z"
          },
          "2fe221a11d3c485861317e9747d02abec74b807e" : {
            "ShortMessage" : "Replaced URLs",
            "CommitTime" : "2018-07-27T05:22:32Z",
            "src/example/F.java" : {
              "FileEditType" : "MODIFIED",
              "0" : {
                "Type" : "DELETED",
                "OldURL" : "http://github.com/takashi-ishio/3",
                "OldLine" : 11,
                "OldCommentLine" : 10
              },
              "1" : {
                "Type" : "ADDED",
                "NewURL" : "http://github.com/takashi-ishio/3",
                "NewLine" : 12,
                "NewCommentLine" : 10
              }
            }
          }
        }



## Supported Languages

The tool chooses a lexer for a source file using its file extension (case-insensitive).

|Language|File Extensions|Comment Features|
|:-------|:--------------|:---------------|
|C/C++ 14|.c, .cc, .cp, .cpp, .cx, .cxx, .c+, .c++, .h, .hh, .hxx, .h+, .h++, .hp, .hpp|`//`, `/* ... */`|
|Java 8|.java|`//`, `/* ... */`|
|ECMAScript|.js|`//`, `/* ... */`|
|C#|.cs|`//`, `/* ... */`|
|Python 3|.py|`#` and long string literals (""" ... """). The literals include docstrings and regular string literals.|
|PHP|.php|`//`, `/* ... */`, `#`, and HTML comments. It may not preserve white space, because PHP allows `<?php // comment ?>` in a single line.|
|Ruby 2.3|.rb|`#`, `=begin ... =end`|

For developers: The rules are included in `jp.naist.se.commentlister.FileType` class.

Note that single-line comments in consecutive lines are regarded as a single multi-line comment, if the comments have the same char position in the lines. The following snippets are examples.

```Ruby
# 1st line
# 2nd line
```

```c++
/* 1st line */
/* 2nd line */
```

```c++
int x = 0;   // 1st line
             // 2nd line
```


## Performance

Simple execution (not an organized evaluation) on a workstation with Xeon E5-2690 v3 2.60GHz results:
 - 56 seconds for Linux git repository (42,000 files, 2.1 GB)
 - 218 seconds for Intellij-Community git repository (66,000 files, 2.8GB)
 - 1502 seconds for Gecko-dev git repository (90,000 files, 3.8 GB)


## Utilities

The project also contains two utilities.


### FileAnalyzer to directly extract comments from source files

This command takes file names as arguments and extracts comments from the files.
Here is an example to extract comments from source files in `src` directory.

     java -classpath CommentLister.jar jp.naist.se.commentlister.FileAnalyzer src

You can specify multiple file and directory names in a single command line.


### GitFileList to count the number of files in a git repo

This command takes a git repo and file patterns.

     java -classpath CommentLister.jar jp.naist.se.commentlister.GitFileCount path/to/.git [-f pattern] [-target=tag/commitId]

`-f pattern` specifies a wild card pattern like "*.java".
The command accepts multiple patterns and reports the number of files for each pattern in the revision.


## Directory Structure

  - `src/main` is the main source directory.
    - `src/main/java` includes main java files.
    - `src/main/antlr4` includes grammar files to generate lexers.  
      - The files come from https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/. 
      - Some of them are modified to push comments into HIDDEN channel, since the original ones simply discard the comments.  
    - `src/main/resources` includes a ruby file to parse Ruby source files.
